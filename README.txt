My original goal was to create a sort of world in which the dog finds the keys and goes to the afterlife, which kind of flips the theme of "Everything is Alive" on its head. I wanted even ghosts to be "alive" in this game. The original goal was to go through and have this little dog collect all the keys and avoid the ghosts, which in turn let it unlock the path to the afterlife/peace/etc. This was originally based on a game that my friend had told me about but I had not personally played called Spiritfarer, which looked like a cute game and the unique idea of it was what inspired me with my game. 
The controls are somewhat inverted due to the way that I set up the camera, so it does take some getting used to. WASD standard + leftshift to run. 

This is the link to my original game proposal:

I stuck primarily to the assets that I used, although I ultimately decided I didn't want to use the shader as I didn't like the way that it looked with the rest of the game and didnt feel like it quite fit.
